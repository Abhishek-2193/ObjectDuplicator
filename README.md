# ObjectDuplicator
# Python script for Maya API to generate duplicates of objects in scene

Version 1: Script duplicates objects on click as selected from a menu of toggle buttons. When the button for a particular object is toggled on, clicking anywhere in the scene will generate a duplicate at click position. 

Version 2: Alternate version where duplicate object is generated based on currently selected object and not a button list.
